Testing MPU6050 for Pitch and  Roll only using Putty

This code is a modified version of Jeff Brokking's 2d IMU using LCD display.(http://www.brokking.net/imu.html).
This code is modified to substitute LCD with Putty or any serial monitor. The default Arduino serial monitor is not great for refreshing sensor data. Putty is a better monitor tool.
Download Putty from (https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).
Install and open in Serial connection type. Mention the exact serial port (Arduino COM port) and baud rate (57600).
Couldn't get multiline display to work. This is single line display for pitch and roll.
